aight so, turn off anti-virus before you run the installation. installation is quite straightforward. installation does two things, firstly, it runs a .exe script to add the quick login script to the Windows Startup Window so that an automatic login takes place when the pc is loaded up. and the second, it installs an application and creates a shortcut for it on the desktop. for quick access, the application can be minimised and it would be stored in the system tray. you can do a login from the system tray directly or just open the window again.

i have like a million things i could add to improvise user experience and gui, and i plan on doing that at some point, hopefully. although rn, would appreciate raising any issues or ideas w the actual login script itself or the pipeline or literally anything but the design.

### stuff i used:
selenium made it quite simple to do the scripting work.
used tkinter for the application iteself.
and used installforge for creating the installation wizard file.

## funny story:
ran into [meghraj](https://GitHub.com/megz15). smh.
turns out that selenium is THE worst way to do this. and i can send a push request using requests. so,scope for improvement indeed.
