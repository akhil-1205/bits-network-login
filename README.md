aight so, turn off anti-virus before you run the installation. installation is quite straightforward. installation does two things, firstly, it runs a .exe script to add the quick login script to the Windows Startup Window so that an automatic login takes place when the pc is loaded up. and the second, it installs an application and creates a shortcut for it on the desktop. for quick access, the application can be minimised and it would be stored in the system tray. you can do a login from the system tray directly or just open the window again.

i have like a million things i could add to improvise user experience and gui, and i plan on doing that at some point, hopefully. although, would appreciate any issues or ideas w the actual login script itself.
